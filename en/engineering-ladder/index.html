<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Engineering ladders <mark>are structured models in progressive levels that serve as a career guide, establishing clear expectations for each level</mark>. These levels consider criteria such as technical skills, impact, leadership ability, and collaboration, for example. <mark>They act as a compass, guiding professionals in their career progression and helping managers align expectations and support the growth of each team member</mark> in a transparent way.</p>
<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<h3 id="how-many-levels-exist-and-what-are-they">How many levels exist, and what are they?</h3>
<p>There is no single rule in the industry defining how many levels exist, as each company has its own structure. However, a general pattern can be observed, these are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Intern: typically students or recent graduates</mark> who are taking their first steps in the field. They have limited or no responsibilities.</li>
<li><mark>Junior: has some practical experience</mark> but is still developing fundamental skills. Responsibilities are generally limited to daily routine tasks. This level typically ranges from 0 to 2 years of experience.</li>
<li><mark>Mid-Level: has solid experience in their area of expertise</mark> and can mentor less experienced team members. They work autonomously and usually share responsibility for the systems developed by the team. This level generally requires at least 2 years of experience.</li>
<li><mark>Senior: has greater experience</mark> and technical expertise in their field, in addition to mentoring previous levels. They are usually responsible for the systems developed by their team or department and may act as a tech lead. This level generally requires at least 5 years of experience.</li>
<li><mark>Staff: combines advanced technical expertise and organizational influence</mark>. Typically, they work beyond their team, leading large-scale initiatives and collaborating with multiple teams to implement broader solutions. This level generally requires at least 8 years of experience.</li>
<li><mark>Principal: plays a strategic role</mark> in defining long-term technical directions for the company. They are generally responsible for cross-functional decisions and influence the evolution of processes and technologies. This level typically requires at least 10 years of experience.</li>
<li><mark>Distinguished Engineer: recognized for exceptional contributions and innovation</mark>. Their position and objectives vary significantly across companies, but generally, they operate at the organizational level, influencing standards, culture, and long-term vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that some companies may use Staff and Principal differently depending on their organizational structures. Additionally, the timeframes suggested here are only general references and not strict rules. Small or medium-sized companies may not have all levels.</p>
<p>Many companies define their career ladders using numerical levels instead of job titles. <mark>You can explore the levels of major companies at <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

<h3 id="where-can-i-find-these-engineering-ladders">Where can I find these engineering ladders?</h3>
<p>Engineering ladders <mark>are commonly found in large technology companies</mark>, often, but not exclusively, linked to a performance evaluation process. However, there are two key points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Smaller companies or those outside the tech industry</mark>: Many of these companies <mark>have little or no formal career ladders</mark>, meaning you will need to rely on industry practices to guide your professional development.</li>
<li><mark>Companies may have an internal focus</mark>: Even in companies with well-defined career ladders, the structure may be designed to meet internal organizational needs. This means that <mark>expectations may not fully reflect market trends or demands</mark>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, it is essential that <mark>you do not limit yourself to your company&rsquo;s vision</mark>. Seek to understand <mark>various industry models</mark> to identify common career progressions, the required skills, responsibilities, and expected impact at each level. This way, you will be prepared not only to grow within your current company but also to seize opportunities elsewhere in the future. Staying aligned with the market ensures that your career path is strong and adaptable, regardless of the organizational context.</p>
<p><mark>There are many different models, in this guide, we will explore two good ones, but you can find many others at <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

<h3 id="model-1-engineering-ladders-by-jorge-fioranelli">Model 1: Engineering Ladders by Jorge Fioranelli</h3>
<p>This is a visual model <mark>created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgefioranelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <b><i>Jorge Fioranelli</i></b>
</a>
, using a radar chart to represent the competencies and responsibilities</mark> expected at different engineering positions.</p>
<p><mark>The model is structured around five key dimensions</mark>, each representing a crucial aspect of professional growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology: knowledge of the tech stack and tools</li>
<li>System: level of ownership of the system(s)</li>
<li>People: relationship with the team(s)</li>
<li>Process: level of engagement with the development process</li>
<li>Influence: scope of influence of the position</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Each axis has five proficiency levels</mark>, ranging from basic adoption to leadership and innovation in technology and processes.</p>
<p>An interesting insight from this model is that career progression is not just about deepening technical knowledge. For example, moving from level 1 to level 2 is often more about improving processes, collaboration, and design rather than learning a new programming language or framework. However, progressing from level 2 to level 3 requires more advanced technical specialization. <mark>This demonstrates that software development goes beyond just technology, involving processes, collaboration, and design.</mark></p>
<p>The model covers 4 different roles. In the case of software engineering, called developer in the model, there are 7 levels, <mark>let&rsquo;s look at an example of what is expected at level 4, senior</mark>:</p>
<img src="http://www.engineeringladders.com/charts/developer-4.png" alt="Engineering Ladder Chart" style="width: 100%;">
<ul>
<li>Technology: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team</li>
<li>System: <mark>owns the production operation and monitoring</mark> of the system and is aware of its SLAs</li>
<li>People: <mark>mentors others to accelerate their career-growth</mark> and encourages them to participate</li>
<li>Process: challenges the team processes, looking for ways to improve them</li>
<li>Influence: <mark>makes an impact on the whole team</mark>, not just on specific parts of it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="model-2-dropbox-engineering-career-framework">Model 2: Dropbox Engineering Career Framework</h3>
<p>This model is impact-driven, <mark>created by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <b><i>Dropbox</i></b>
</a>
, with a focus on helping engineers reflect on their work and understand how to create impact</mark>.</p>
<p>The model <mark>is divided into two main components</mark> for each level:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Expectations</mark>: defines the scope of work, collaboration, and key impact factors. This component differentiates the levels.</li>
<li><mark>Core and Craft Responsibilities</mark>: defines behaviors and competencies expected to maximize impact. This component is structured around results, direction, talent, culture, and technical specialization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model covers 9 different roles, 5 more than the previous model. In the case of software engineering, called SWE in the model, there are 7 levels, <mark>let&rsquo;s look at an example of what is expected at level 4, senior</mark>:</p>
